  "code_summary": "Folder 'code_summary' summary:\nThe repository contains scripts and tools for summarizing the contents of a local folder or a GitHub repository. The key components include:\n\n1. **`documentation_gradio.py`**: Provides a Gradio-based interface for loading and viewing saved summaries and summary trees. It includes functions to list and load saved summaries, and to interact with summary trees.\n\n2. **`main.py`**: The main script that processes and summarizes a local folder or a GitHub repository. It handles command-line arguments, clones repositories, builds folder trees, generates summaries, and saves the results.\n\n3. **`README.md`**: Instructions for running the repository, including requirements and command-line arguments for executing summarizations and viewing them using Gradio.\n\n4. **`requirements.txt`**: Lists the dependencies needed to run the repository.\n\n5. **Subfolder `example_repos`**: Contains saved summary files in both text and JSON formats.\n\n6. **Subfolder `functions`**: Contains multiple Python scripts for various functionalities:\n   - **`files_exclusion.py`**: Defines exclusion rules and handles `.gitignore` patterns.\n   - **`folder_summarization.py`**: Generates summaries for folders.\n   - **`folder_tree.py`**: Builds and flattens the folder tree structure.\n   - **`genai_summary.py`**: Generates summaries using the Mistral AI API.\n   - **`process_file.py`**: Reads and processes file content for summarization.\n   - **`utils.py`**: Provides utility functions for cloning repositories and summarizing them.\n   - **`__init__.py`**: Indicates the directory is a Python package.\n\nThe repository is designed to clone a GitHub repository, build a folder tree while applying exclusion rules, process file contents, generate summaries using an AI model, and save the results for further use.",
