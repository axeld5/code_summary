2. **Makefile**: Contains easy-to-run commands for style checking, quality checking, testing, and evaluating models. It supports data parallel and tensor parallel evaluations.
3. **README.md**: Provides an overview, installation instructions, and guidelines for training and evaluating models. It includes steps for reproducing DeepSeek's evaluation results and generating data.
4. **setup.cfg and setup.py**: Configuration files for setting up the project, including dependencies and extras for different use cases like training, evaluation, and development.
5. **assets**: Includes a plan-of-attack image.
6. **logs**: Details missing.
7. **recipes**: Contains configuration files for different training and evaluation setups, such as DDP, Zero-2, and Zero-3.
8. **scripts**: Includes scripts for generating reasoning completions and running benchmarks.
9. **slurm**: SLURM scripts for evaluating, generating data, serving models, and training on a compute cluster.
10. **src**: Contains the main code for training and evaluating models, including configurations, custom tasks, and utility functions.
11. **tests**: Contains unit tests for reward functions used in evaluation.

### Installation and Usage:
- **Installation**: Requires Python 3.11, specific versions of libraries like `vLLM` and `PyTorch`, and setting up virtual environments.
- **Training**: Supports supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and group relative policy optimization (GRPO) with configurations for different models and datasets.
- **Evaluation**: Uses `lighteval` for evaluating models on various benchmarks like MATH-500 and GPQA Diamond.
- **Data Generation**: Includes scripts for generating synthetic data using models like DeepSeek-R1.
